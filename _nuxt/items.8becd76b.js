We build this model with using 2 different datasets. With course dataset we build a clustering model using K-Means algorithm with K = 1500. With the clustering model we can get the cluster of each course. With the cluster we can get the course that is most similar to the course that we want to recommend.
 After clustering we made sentimental analysis over the reviews of each course. With the sentimental analysis we generate an aggregate compound score for each course. With this score we show user how the reviews of the course are.
 Using the model we build a recommendation system with web interface. With the interface, user can select a learning category, enter a topic to learn and choose a course level. With these data we suggest maximum 5 unique courses to the user to check out.`},{id:"2",title:"Birdle",thumbnail:"https://github.com/umitkara/birdle/raw/master/ss/1.png",categories:["web","php","vue","programming"],link:"",repo:"https://github.com/umitkara/birdle",tech:["Laravel","PHP","Vue","JavaScript","HTML","CSS","MySQL"],images:["https://github.com/umitkara/birdle/raw/master/ss/4.png","https://github.com/umitkara/birdle/raw/master/ss/5.png","https://github.com/umitkara/birdle/raw/master/ss/6.png","https://github.com/umitkara/birdle/raw/master/ss/7.png","https://github.com/umitkara/birdle/raw/master/ss/8.png","https://github.com/umitkara/birdle/raw/master/ss/9.png","https://github.com/umitkara/birdle/raw/master/ss/10.png","https://github.com/umitkara/birdle/raw/master/ss/11.png"],description:`Birdle is a personal development project.

 I know that the proper way is to handle entry point on one file and use require to load the other files. But i doing this way is easier to understand for me.

False positives are possible, but false negatives are not. Elements can be added tothe set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a counting filter). The more elements that are added tothe set, the larger the probability of false positives.</p><a href="https://github.com/umitkara/Bloom-Filter" class="underline">Github Repo</a><br /><p class="font-semibold">Heap:</p><p>It is a data structure that takes the form of a nearly completebinary tree.

Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the keyassociated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All thedescendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated withthe empty string. Values are not necessarily associated with every node. Rather, values tend only to be associatedwith leaves, and with some inner nodes that correspond to keys of interest.</p><a href="https://github.com/umitkara/Trie-DS" class="underline">Github Repo</a><br /><p class="font-semibold">Cache:</p><p>It is a data structure that stores data so that future requests forthat data can be served faster. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation, or theduplicate of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cachemiss occurs when it cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache which is faster than recomputing aresult or reading from a slower data store. Thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster thesystem performs. Popular caches include the browser cache, the DNS cache, and the page cache of an operating system.</p><a href="https://github.com/umitkara/Cache-DS" class="underline">Github Repo</a><br />'},{id:"7",title:"Flutty Birdle",thumbnail:"https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss3.png",categories:["mobile","programming"],link:"https://twitterclone-22580.web.app/",repo:"https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter",tech:["Flutter","Dart","Firebase"],images:["https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss1.png","https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss2.png","https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss3.png","https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss4.png","https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss5.png","https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss6.png","https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss7.png","https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss8.png","https://github.com/umitkara/twitter_clone_flutter/raw/master/ss/ss9.png"],description:"Flutty Birdle is a Flutter based Twitter clone with core Twitter functionality.
