I always tried to open the electronic devices we had when I was a child. Attempted to look what they had inside and wanted to understand how they worked. There was a time when I tried to fix long-broken devices.","I had this curiosity because my dad had this knowledge. He could repair broken electronic devices. He soldered some components onto green, rectangle boards. After this process, some of those broken devices come back to life.","On those days, I saw those small resistors and capacitors. As most children do, I was curious about what was inside of them. I didn't get an answer to my question until my school years, which was also due to my laziness. But in school, in physics lessons, I learn most of how those components work, whats inside of them and when and where to use them.","LED","\u002FblogImg\u002Fpage5\u002F3.webp","When I first saw this book, Open Circuits, and took a look inside, I thought, I would have been able to get all of the information that I needed if it existed at the time. The book not only shows the inside of an electrical component, but also explains its basics. It shows cross section photos of real components as well as some commonly used cables and integrated circuits.","HDMI","\u002FblogImg\u002Fpage5\u002F2.webp","Having worked in this field for a long time, I still find it exciting to see the chip in a dual-inline package. It's a well-written book with high quality images and explanations. Every enthusiast should have one. It realy show the inner beauty of electronic components...","(Link to ","a","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FOpen-Circuits-Beauty-Electronic-Components\u002Fdp\u002F1718502346","nofollow","Amazon",")","Ümit Kara","https:\u002F\u002Fumitkara.github.io\u002FblogImg\u002Fpage5\u002Fcover.webp",2))
